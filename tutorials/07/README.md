Two companies A, located in Canada, and B, located in France, want to collaborate on a super secret project. Each company has its own internal network with private servers and they want to allow the other company to access them.

These two companies have hired you as a consultant to help them to enable their collaboration wile keeping their project secret. They are giving you a list of concerns: 

- if the network is opened to the "outside", anybody could connect to their servers?
- someone outside of their network might be able to eavesdrop or hijack their communication?
- people might suspect that the two are working on super secret project if they see the type of communication they have?

For each concern, they are asking you to:
